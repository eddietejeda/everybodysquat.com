[DRAFT]

So I made a thing. Just as a side hobby, but I think it's early enough in the process that I should share. 

First, a little backstory: A few years ago, when I reached the age when avoiding long term health effects is not optional, 
I started exercising -- more importantly, I started squatting. After a little while, I noticed that I was stronger than I expected. 
I also noticed that my diet changed in response to wanting to continue to improve my squatting and all my health indicators  improved, 
dramatically. 

It was a great experience, so I started encouring my friends to squat and they also got stronger. And that's been going on for a many years now. 
I've lost count how many people I've shown how to squat and now I want to show more people squat.

Briefly, here is why the squat is important: your legs and you back make up most of your body's total muscle. There only a few momements that allow 
you to use up so much of your body's total strength in one move motion and the squat, is, arguably, the best movement. So when you squat, 
your body has not choice but to get stronger.

The most important thing about getting a stronger in the squat is knowing how to 
2.5lb might not seem like a lot, can add up quickly. 

 So I made a small tool to help me track my squat "dosng" and encourage my friends to squat.

Please note: I made this over a couple long weekends and I know that could be much better, but I can only improve it if I get feedback. But first, 
you'll need to improve your squat.
